Manuscripts are composed of key sections such as Title, Abstract, Introduction, Problem Statement, Proposed Method, and Conclusion, which play a crucial role in research evaluation. This project implements a system using a Large Language Model (LLM) combined with advanced techniques like text extraction, cleaning, and summarization. The system processes a PDF manuscript to identify and summarize sections using the Sumy library, while semantic similarity between sections is calculated with SentenceTransformer embeddings and cosine similarity. Adjusted weights are applied to prioritize specific sections, ensuring a more accurate relevance assessment. This approach provides an intelligent and efficient framework for manuscript evaluation, offering researchers a streamlined way to analyze the structure and content of a paper. A unique aspect of this project is its ability to efficiently identify relationships between manuscript sections, enabling researchers to easily evaluate the relevance and coherence of a paper's content.
